'''

For the interpolations there are four methods took my attention in meteorology.

Linear interpolation (interp1d)
B-spline interpolation (make_interp_spline)
Cubic interpolation (CubicSpline)
Radial basis function (RBF) interpolation (Rbf)
'''

from scipy import interpolate

# We should use Cubic because of the performance of computation and the results.

# Assuming you have x, y, and z as your data points
# x, y should be 1-D arrays, and z should be a 2-D array
# You may need to flatten your data if it's not in the required format

# Create an interpolation function
f = interpolate.interp2d(x, y, z, kind='cubic')

# Define new grid points for interpolation
new_x = np.linspace(min(x), max(x), num=100)
new_y = np.linspace(min(y), max(y), num=100)

# Perform the interpolation
new_z = f(new_x, new_y)
