#  Synopsis:
#    Illustrates how to draw three visualizations on a single frame.

#
#  Description:
#    Illustrates how to put multiple plots on a page and how
#    to have a common label bar for all plots on the page.
#    Also illustrates the three map database resolutions.
#
#  Effects illustrated:
#    o  How to handle missing values.
#    o  How to put multiple plots on a page.
#    o  Drawing contours over maps.
#    o  Some special paneling resources.
#    o  A common label bar for all plots.
#    o  The three map database resolutions.
# 
#  Output:
#    This examples produces a single visualization showing
#    three individual contour plots on a single frame with
#    a common label bar.
#
#  Notes:
#    The geographic area in the maps is the sea of Japan.
#    The data are artificially generated with a missing
#    value of 1.e+10 outside the contoured area.
#     
#    In order to get high-resolution coastlines,  you must have the 
#    RANGS/GSHHS database installed. Otherwise, this example will
#    revert to using medium-resolution coastlines.
#
#    For information on getting the RANGS/GSHHS database, see:
